Thanks to the folks at w3schools for posting such excellent reference materials. Also, sass-lang.com was useful for getting SCSS up and running quickly and easily.

The project requires node.js to be installed. You can install the SASS transpiler with this line:
npm install -g sass

build.bat will transpile the scss file and copy it over, along with the html and js files, to the build directory. Now, you just need to navigate a browser to the html document.
